title: "About Me"
content: |
  I am Yu-Cian Tsai (蔡雨虔) a PhD candidate in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University, working with Prof. Eric Maloney. My research centers on subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) prediction, with a focus on how the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO), easterly waves (EWs), and tropical cyclones (TCs) interact to influence East Pacific weather and climate variability. 
  My current work examines how NOAA’s Unified Forecast System (UFS) represents East Pacific easterly wave track density, with particular attention to how biases in eddy kinetic energy (EKE) and moisture–vorticity coupling affect wave frequency, structure, and intensity. 
 
  My previous research evaluated UFS MJO forecast skill across a range of initial phases, identifying conditions in which the model can sustain MJO amplitude for multiple weeks as well as systematic biases in phase progression and amplitude decay. I have also investigated internal MJO dynamics, including the convective recharge–discharge cycle and how different MJO event types evolve and propagate. Through this work, I aim to improve both the physical understanding and model representation of tropical variability to enhance prediction of rainfall variability and tropical cyclone precursors on S2S timescales.
